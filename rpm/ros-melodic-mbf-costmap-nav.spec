%description
The mbf_costmap_nav package contains the costmap navigation server
implementation of Move Base Flex (MBF). The costmap navigation server is bound
to the costmap_2d representation. It provides the Actions for planning,
controlling and recovering. At the time of start MBF loads all defined plugins.
Therefor, it loads all plugins which are defined in the lists *planners*,
*controllers* and *recovery_behaviors*. Each list holds a pair of a *name* and a
*type*. The *type* defines which kind of plugin to load. The *name* defines
under which name the plugin should be callable by the actions. Additionally the
mbf_costmap_nav package comes with a wrapper for the old navigation stack and
the plugins which inherits from the nav_core base classes. Preferably it tries
to load plugins for the new API. However, plugins could even support both
move_base and move_base_flex by inheriting both base class interfaces located in
the nav_core package and in the mbf_costmap_core package.
