%description
This package provides common interfaces for navigation specific robot actions.
It contains the AbstractPlanner, AbstractController and AbstractRecovery plugin
interfaces. This interfaces have to be implemented by the plugins to make the
plugin available for Move Base Flex. The abstract classes provides a meaningful
interface enabling the planners, controllers and recovery behaviors to return
information, e.g. why something went wrong. Derivided interfaces can, for
example, provide methods to initialize the planner, controller or recovery with
map representations like costmap_2d, grid_map or other representations.
