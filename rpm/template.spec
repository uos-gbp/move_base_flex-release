%description
This package provides common interfaces for navigation specific robot actions.
It contains the CostmapPlanner, CostmapController and CostmapRecovery
interfaces. The interfaces have to be implemented by the plugins to make them
available for Move Base Flex using the mbf_costmap_nav navigation
implementation. That implementation inherits the mbf_abstract_nav implementation
and binds the system to a local and a global costmap.

# in the install tree that was dropped by catkin, and source it.  It will
# set things like CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH, PKG_CONFIG_PATH, and PYTHONPATH.
